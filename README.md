# Linear_Regression_Task
## Task Definition

You are expected to generate a fake Nairobi Office Price Simulated dataset of size 100 with One
feature 𝒙 (office size assume a suitable distribution) and one target 𝑦 (office price also assume a
suitable distribution).
Write class logic for Mean Squared Error to be used as your Performance Measure Technique
and Gradient Descent as your learning algorithm
Set random initial values for slope (m) and y-intercept (c) and train an intelligent linear regression
model of your dataset above then plot the line of best fit
Use the above learnt line to predict the office price when the size is 100 sq. ft.

Dataset comprised random data, created from the site: https://www.mockaroo.com
